# Building a Language Model from Scratch

## Introduction

In this project, I embarked on building a language model from scratch using resources provided by Andrej Karpathy. The goal was to gain a deep understanding of the fundamental components that constitute modern language models and to implement them manually to solidify my knowledge.

## What I've Learned

### Tokenization Basics and Data Loaders
- **Tokenization:** Learned the fundamentals of breaking down text into tokens, handling vocabulary creation, and managing token indices.
- **Data Loaders:** Developed efficient data loaders for handling and preprocessing text datasets, ensuring smooth feeding of data into the model during training.

### Bigram Language Model
- **BigramLanguageModel:** Implemented a simple bigram language model to understand the basics of probabilistic language modeling and how models predict the next word based on the previous one.

### Self-Attention Transformers
- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Explored how transformers use self-attention to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies.
- **Transformer Architecture:** Studied the overall architecture of transformers, including multi-head attention and feed-forward networks.

### Residual Connections
- **Residual Connections:** Implemented residual (skip) connections to facilitate the training of deep networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.

### Batch Normalization and Dropout
- **BatchNorm:** Applied batch normalization to stabilize and accelerate the training process by normalizing layer inputs.
- **Dropout:** Utilized dropout techniques to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.

## Current Progress

- **Pretraining:** Conducted extensive pretraining of a document completion transformer language model, achieving satisfactory performance in generating coherent and contextually relevant text completions.
- **Model Architecture:** Built and fine-tuned the transformer architecture with self-attention, residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout layers.

## Next Steps

### Enhancements and Implementations
1. **Custom Tokenizer:**
   - Develop a tokenizer from scratch to better understand the intricacies of tokenization and potentially improve tokenization performance tailored to specific datasets.
   
2. **GPT-2 Implementation:**
   - Implement the GPT-2 architecture to leverage its advanced capabilities in language modeling and generation.

### Finetuning the Model
1. **Gathering Data for Supervised Policy:**
   - Collect and curate high-quality datasets to train a supervised policy, enhancing the model's ability to perform specific tasks.
   
2. **Collecting Comparison Data:**
   - Assemble comparison datasets to train the supervised policy, enabling the model to make informed decisions based on comparative analysis.
   
3. **Optimizing Policy with Reward Models:**
   - Utilize reward models such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning to fine-tune the policy, improving performance based on defined rewards.

### Exploring Data Quality Optimization
- Investigate how the quality of training data impacts the performance of the GPT model.
- Implement strategies to enhance data quality, such as data cleaning, augmentation, and balancing, to optimize the model's effectiveness and reliability.

## Future Directions

- **Advanced Finetuning Techniques:** Explore more sophisticated finetuning methods, including transfer learning and multi-task learning, to further enhance the model's versatility.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Develop comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess model performance across various tasks and datasets.
- **Deployment:** Plan for deploying the trained model in real-world applications, ensuring scalability and robustness.

## Conclusion

This project has provided a solid foundation in building and understanding language models from the ground up. By continuing to implement advanced features and focusing on finetuning and data optimization, I aim to develop a robust and high-performing language model capable of tackling complex natural language processing tasks.
